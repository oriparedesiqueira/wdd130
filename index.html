        <p>Hello! My name is Oriana Cineret Paredes Carmona. I'm Venezuelan, but I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I love living in Brazil, it's a fantastic country. I've been in Brazil for 5 years. I am a Portuguese and Spanish teacher. I'm 23 years old. I left Venezuela when I was 19 years old together with my mother Jackeline, my stepfather Ignacio and my sisters Valeria and Emma. I am the oldest sister of my sisters. Two years ago, I returned from serving as a full-time missionary in Salvador, Brazil. The years 2022 and 2023 were among the best years of my life. I met Bruno, a Brazilian boy and got married in November 2023 to him for life and eternity. I have been married for 4 months and it has been one of the most learning and happy moments of my life. With the programming course, I have the goal of developing the necessary skills to work together with my husband, who is a programmer, and to have a development company together.</p>
